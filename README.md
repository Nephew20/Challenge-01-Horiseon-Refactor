# Challenge-01-Horiseon-Refactor
## Description

The purpose of this challenge was to get a better understanding of refactoring code. As a developer, refactoring allows the developer to improve the functionality and flow of code. This helps with reducing the risk of bugs and when working in teams with other developers, it helps them read your code to understand what is supposed to be happening. Challenge 01, presented a code that produced a website that functioned but had bugs such as not moving through the site when a one of the navigation links were clicked and a lack of semantic elemnts which made it hard to understand where information was supposed to be on the page. Also the CSS stylesheet had a lot of redundant code that could be simplified. The lesson to learn from this challenge was to show how to properly debug an issue, how semantic elements affect the placement of information for the website, and how to get the most out of using less code.  

## Installation

No steps are required to install the website. 

## Usage
